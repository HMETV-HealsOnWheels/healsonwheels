    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      HMETV is an autonomous medical supply cart designed to improve hospital efficiency by transporting medical supplies, samples, and medicine within hospital environments. It alleviates the workload on nurses, reducing physical strain and allowing them to focus on patient care. Users of the HMETV will be able to schedule deliveries and order supplies through a GUI integrated into the hospitalâ€™s Wi-Fi network.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Hospitals are fast-paced environments where time, accuracy, and efficiency are essential. Medical staff must follow strict schedules, maintain sterile conditions, and provide high-quality care, all while managing numerous routine tasks. These ongoing demands often result in increased stress, fatigue, and reduced attention to critical responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      One recurring but time-consuming task in hospital units, such as the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, involves retrieving and delivering essential medical supplies. Items like gauze, syringes, and saline are stored in central supply rooms that are often located far from patient care areas. Nurses frequently have to leave their assigned patients to collect these supplies, which can reduce their availability for urgent care needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To address this issue, our team is developing the Hospital Medical Equipment Transport Vehicle, an autonomous medical cart that assists staff by handling supply deliveries. This project builds upon previous work aimed at improving hospital workflows and reducing the burden placed on nurses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to enhance efficiency, support timely access to necessary items during emergencies, and allow healthcare workers to focus more on direct patient care. By automating these logistical tasks, the project seeks to improve overall operations and help create a more supportive and responsive hospital environment.
